Goal: Use my skills in Python and SQL to return to the data analysis field by turning my resume into a structured, queryable dataset.

Project Description
As part of my data analyst training, I decided to build my resume as a relational database to demonstrate my technical abilities in:
- Database design: I structured my entire resume into normalized tables, defining appropriate relationships between entities (education, experience, skills, etc.).
- Excel modeling: I prepared the dataset in Excel, using separate sheets to represent each table. I carefully filled each one with accurate and relevant information.
- Data manipulation with Python: Using Pandas, I read and merged the tables, cleaned the data, and built custom views for each section of my resume (education, projects, work experience, skills).

This project was both useful and fun â€” and it's only the first of many! I plan to keep building creative projects that reflect my skills and growth.
